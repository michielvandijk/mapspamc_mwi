# mapspamc_mwi

This repository contains the scripts to create crop distribution maps
with the [`mapspamc`](https://github.com/michielvandijk/mapspamc) R
package for Malawi. To run the scripts, the user needs to install
`mapspamc` and download the [mapspamc database](ADD%20link), which
includes all the required input data, including subnational statistics
for Malawi as well as global maps. Detailed information on how to
install the package and run the Malawi case-study is provided in the
articles of the `mapspamc` package website
(<https://michielvandijk.github.io/mapspamc/>). Additional information
is available in a scientific journal article (Dijk et al. 2022). Please
cite this article if you use the `mapspamc`package.
