# mapspamc_mwi

This repository contains the scripts to create crop distribution maps with the [`mapspamc`](https://github.com/michielvandijk/mapspamc) R package for Malawi. To run the scripts, the user needs to install `mapspamc` and download the [mapspamc database](ADD link), which includes all the required input data, including subnational statistics for Malawi as well as global maps. Detailed information on how to install the package and run the Malawi case-study is provided in the articles of the `mapspamc` package website (https://michielvandijk.github.io/mapspamc/). Additional information is available in a scientific journal article [@VanDijk2022b]. Please cite this article if you use the `mapspamc`package.
